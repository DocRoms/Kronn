# Agent tier settings must preserve other editors

The Config > Agents editor used a static model list even though the catalogue
table below it had loaded dynamic runtime data. Its load loop also omitted
`open_code`, while its save payload included that key with null defaults.
Changing another agent's tier therefore erased saved OpenCode settings.

The correction reads the shared catalogue, selects the exact runtime namespace
and preserves an unknown configured model as a disabled, explicitly labelled
option. Cache provenance never becomes a live discovery merely because the
snapshot request succeeded. Clearing an override is an explicit action; its
placeholder and card preview show the catalogue's tier assignment when known.

The settings endpoint replaces the whole model-tier document. Before a save,
the editor rereads it and merges only the selected agent/tier, guarded against
synchronous re-entry. It updates its displayed state after a successful write,
not optimistically. This preserves edits already saved by another card, but is
not a server-side compare-and-swap guarantee against another client writing
between that GET and POST.

The component regressions cover dynamic IDs, runtime separation, OpenCode,
manual Kiro/Vibe entries, unavailable/cache metadata, empty/error recovery,
explicit clearing, independent Ollama edits, duplicate clicks and write failure.
They mock the API and do not mutate provider accounts or user settings.
